            <h3> Model Performance </h3>
              <p>We are using machine learning to produce predictions for the Oscar best picture winner. The movie information we are using to make predictions are running time, budget, revenue, gross revenue, director name, director pedigree, 3 actor names, their pedigrees, MPAA rating, rotten tomatoes score, US release month, US release year, and peak box office ranking. Director pedigree is whether the director won Best Director, director nominations to date, and director wins to date. Actor pedigree is whether the actor won Best Actor, actor nominations to date, and actor wins to date. For director and actor names, we are replacing them with unique numerical values. The names are an important parameter to include because there can be two people with a similar pedigree, but one actor can be in more movies that have won Best Picture than the other actor has. The US release year can help the machine recognize if there are certain parameters that have more influence in a movie winning Best Picture as time passes. 
</p><p>
We trained 4 models with a dataset of nominated movies from 2001 to 2020. The 4 models were support vector classifier, random forest classifier, K-neighbors classifier, and logistic regression classifier from the scikit learn library in Python. The highest performing classifiers were the support vector classifier (SVC) and the random forest classifier. After additional parameter tuning, the highest accuracy for SVC was 88.3%, and for the random forest classifier, it was 89.5%. We trained our final model with the random forest classifier on nominated movies from 2001 to 2016. The results below are our predictions from the final classifier we built for the years 2017 to 2020. The final classifier generates the probability of winning Best Picture based on the patterns observed from the 2001 to 2016 movies. We grouped the predictions by year and chose the highest probability for each year as the winner. The predictions for 2017 and 2019 were not what happened in reality. The final classifier most likely predicted La La Land (2017) with a high probability because it had a director that won Best Director and one actor that had 2 nominations to date. It most likely predicted Roma (2019) with a high probability because it had a director that won Best Director and one actor that had 1 nomination to date.</p>
